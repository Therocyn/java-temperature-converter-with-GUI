# Temperature Converter using Java with a GUI :smile:

This is one of my exercise jobs to learn a bit more about Java, it converts Celsius/Kelvin/Fahrenheit all to each other.

## Compilation Instructions

1. To run the code you need to download the [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html).
2. Open the "cmd" and navigate to the folder where you downloaded the program and type:
        ''' java Aplicacao '''
3. If you want to actualize the program, you need to update the "Aplicacao.class" file too, to do this type:
        ''' javac Aplicacao.java ''' and after that go back to step two.
